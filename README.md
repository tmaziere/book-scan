# Book Scan

**This piece of software is not usable (at least not useful) at this moment**

## Install

N.B. : it is better to work in a virtual environment (venv)

- clone this repo
- install dependencies : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- start app : `python scan.py`

## Commands

- hit key `p` to preview pages (left and right)
- hit key `p` again to come back to video mode
- or if preview is OK, hit key `s` to save both pages
